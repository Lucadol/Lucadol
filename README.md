## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lucas, and I have a Master's degree in Sports. However, I've recently decided to pursue a career in web development, and I'm excited to share my GitHub journey with you!

### ðŸ˜„ About Me
As a sports and basketball fan, I have always been passionate about physical activity and the ways it can improve our lives. However, over time, I've come to realize that my true calling lies in the world of technology and software development.

I've been teaching myself web development over the past few months, and I'm eager to showcase some of my projects and skills on GitHub. My main areas of focus are HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but I'm also open to exploring other technologies and frameworks.

### âš¡ My GitHub Projects
So far, I've created a few projects on GitHub <!--that I'm particularly proud of-->:

[Project 1]: I made a portfolio of a videographer who presents his passion, his videos, and his prices <br>
[Project 2]: I made a basketball blog that tells the story of the Lakers' playoff adventure against the Grizzlies <br>
[Project 3]: I made the presentation page of a dress sales website. It's a design oriented website that I really enjoyed making <br>

I'm constantly working on new projects and learning new skills, so I encourage you to check back often for updates!

### ðŸ”­ What I'm Looking For
I'm currently seeking opportunities to collaborate with other developers, contribute to open source projects, and gain more experience in the field of web development. If you have any suggestions or opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me!

Thank you for taking the time to read my GitHub profile. I'm excited to see what the future holds in store for me as a web developer!
