Hello everyone! 👋

My name is Lucas, a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in web development. As a passionate basketball player, I decided to change directions to pursue my love for web development.

😄 About Me
As a sports enthusiast, especially in basketball, I've always been fascinated by physical activity and its benefits. However, over time, I realized that my true calling lies in the world of technology and software development.

I've spent the past few months self-learning web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to share my projects and skills on GitHub, while remaining open to exploring other technologies and frameworks.

⚡ My GitHub Projects
Here are some of my projects on GitHub:

[Project 6]: Developed a React project called "Kasa" resembling Airbnb.
[Project 7]: Created a backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for a project named "Les Vieux Grimoires."
[Project 8]: Designed my portfolio using React, Tailwind, and Three.js.
I'm constantly working on new projects and expanding my skills. Feel free to check back regularly for the latest updates!

🔭 What I'm Looking For
Currently seeking opportunities to collaborate with other developers, contribute to open source projects, and gain more experience in the field of web development. If you have any suggestions or opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me!
